# The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard
# so that no two queens attack each other.


# 1) Start in the leftmost column
# 2) If all queens are placed
#     return true
# 3) Try all rows in the current column.  Do following for every tried row.
#     a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row then mark this [row,
#         column] as part of the solution and recursively check if placing
#         queen here leads to a solution.
#     b) If placing queen in [row, column] leads to a solution then return
#         true.
#     c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then umark this [row,
#         column] (Backtrack) and go to step (a) to try other rows.
# 3) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger
#     backtracking.
